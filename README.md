# Huffman-Code

## Description
A command line script implementation of Huffman Encoding. Currently encodes an argument string and then decodes and prints it.

## Future improvements
- [ ] Save both huffman tree and binary string encoding in a binary file
- [ ] Be able to decode a binary file containing both both huffman tree and binary string encoding
